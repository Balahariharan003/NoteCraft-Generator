**NoteCraft AI** is a professional-grade, automated ecosystem designed to capture, transcribe, and synthesize live audio from virtual sessions (Google Meet, Zoom, MS Teams). It transforms raw classroom or meeting dialogue into structured, institutional-standard **Minutes of Meeting (MoM)** documents using a high-performance React extension and a robust FastAPI backend.

## ✨ Premium Experience & Features

### 🎨 High-End Dark Aesthetic
*   **Solid Neutral Design**: A transition from generic translucency to a high-contrast, premium solid dark UI optimized for professional focus.
*   **Fluid Floating Widget**: A persistent, draggable FAB (Floating Action Button) that overlays seamlessly on active meeting tabs.
*   **Lag-Free Interaction**: Implemented **React Reference-based dragging** that bypasses state-update cycles, ensuring 60FPS fluid UI movement even during resource-heavy video calls.
*   **Viewport Guardians**: Advanced coordinate normalization prevents the widget from ever being lost outside the browser's viewable area.

### 🎧 Precision Audio Capture
*   **Unified Loopback**: Simultaneously captures Tab Audio (remote speakers) and Microphone Input into a single high-fidelity stream.
*   **MV3 Compliant**: Utilizes a dedicated **Offscreen Document loopback** to maintain continuous recording under strict Chrome Manifest V3 regulations.
*   **Async Chunking**: Audio is fragmented into 30-second segments and dispatched via background non-blocking workers for immediate processing.

### 🧠 Advanced AI Synthesis
*   **Sarvam Saaras STT**: Optimized for diverse speech profiles and accents, delivering high-accuracy transcription with minimal latency.
*   **Map-Reduce Pipeline**: Our proprietary sequential aggregation engine handles long sessions by summarizing blocks of text, preserving context while avoiding LLM token limits.
*   **Institutional Intelligence**: Specifically pre-configured for standardized templates, auto-generating compliant headers, member lists, and structured action-item grids.

## 📋 Operational Workflow

1.  **Activate**: Ensure the backend is running on `localhost:8000`.
2.  **Capture**: Open Google Meet, click the NoteCraft icon, and share **Tab Audio**.
3.  **Monitor**: A floating badge tracks your time. Expand it to see live status.
4.  **Finalize**: Click "Stop Meeting" to trigger the Map-Reduce synthesis.
5.  **Export**: Download your professional, structured MoM as a `.docx` file.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

NoteCraft AI is built with a **Privacy-First** architecture. Audio segments and transcripts are stored in volatile session memory. Once the final document is generated and downloaded, all associated session data is purged from the server, ensuring your meetings remain confidential.
